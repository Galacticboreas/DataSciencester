OOP - every class and method should depend on
abstractions, not concrete implementations.
FP - every function should depend on input
arguments only, not concrete operations.

# According to this principle, all modules - regardless 
# of their levels - should depend not on specific 
# implementations, but on abstractions. Any dependence 
# on specific implementations is a direct violation of 
# the dependency inversion principle.
